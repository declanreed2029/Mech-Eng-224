An implementation of the evaluate function

My thoughts: Due to the if statment in line 26, only numbers before the last operation are being considered so the result is not the full result.
    I added a line at the end of the for loop before the full return of the func to consider the final value in result so that result is the full result.
    This appears to have worked.
